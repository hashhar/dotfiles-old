# Ashhar's Dotfiles

This is my dotfiles repo.
All the dotfiles are present in this repo and there are symlinks created in my `$HOME` using GNU Stow.

Read [this great blog post](http://blog.xero.nu/managing_dotfiles_with_gnu_stow) to get started with using GNU Stow for managing your own dotfiles.

Fork, improve, submit a pull. I will merge it if I find it useful for myself personally.
